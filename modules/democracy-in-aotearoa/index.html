                            <p>In order to represent New Zealand's views, 120 people are elected to the <i>House of Representatives</i>, more commonly known as <i>Parliament</i>. 72 of those people are representatives of a particular area, or <i>electorate.</i> Of these 72 electorates, seven of them are M훮ori electorates, and have been elected by people of M훮ori descent to represent their views. <a href="/modules/m훮ori-representation">Read more about the M훮ori electorates</a>.</p>
                            <p>The other 48 <i>Members of Parliament</i> (or MPs) have been elected by the whole country, as part of the party vote, which you will learn more about later.</p>
