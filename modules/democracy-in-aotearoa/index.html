                                <p>Democracy is how Aotearoa New Zealand gets things done. It is important for a nation to have a system of democracy that represents people, so that the decisions made by those in power reflect the attitudes of the majority of the population.</p>

                            <p>In order to represent New Zealand's views, 120 people are elected to the <i>House of Representatives</i>, more commonly known as <i>Parliament</i>. 72 of those people are representatives of a particular area, or <i>electorate.</i> Of these 72 electorates, seven of them are M훮ori electorates, and have been elected by people of M훮ori descent to represent their views. <a href="/modules/m훮ori-representation">Read more about the M훮ori electorates</a>.</p>
                            <p>The other 48 <i>Members of Parliament</i> (or MPs) have been elected by the whole country, as part of the party vote, which you will learn more about later.</p>

                                    <p>When a particular party gets over 60 seats in the House, which is conveniently half of the total number of seats, they become the government.</p>
                                    <p>Generally in <a href="/modules/how-to-enrol-vote#mmp"><i>MMP</i></a>, not one single party gets all of the votes, so parties have to work together to form <i>coalitions</i> (partnerships), in order to make up the numbers to govern. In the 2020 general election however, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/election-2020/428584/election-2020-labour-claims-victory-national-has-worst-result-in-years">the Labour Party achieved the highest proportion of seats ever under MMP in Aotearoa</a>, winning 64, so were able to govern alone, without the support of another party.</p>
                                    <p>The Parties that did not end up becoming the government become the <i>Opposition</i>. They sit across from the government in the debating chamber.</p>

                                <p>The MPs in the House of Representatives make the decisions that decide what the country does. They do this through debating on, getting the public's input on, and then voting on new laws or changes to laws, on behalf of the people who they represent. Each member gets one vote, and for most new changes to laws to go through, 61 affirming votes are needed. Because the government has a majority, they are able to make the most law changes, but that doesn't mean that the other parties sit around doing nothing.</p>

                                <p>Each of the 120 MPs gets the opportunity to submit a bill of their choice (called a <i>Member's Bill</i>), which are put into a biscuit tin which acts as a ballot that is drawn from several times a year. This can be bypassed if the bill gets support from a majority of MPs. The Member's Bill process has allowed many laws to pass that may not be what the government's focus is on, such as the recent End of Life Choice Act in 2019, which was brought into parliament by Opposition member David Seymour.</p>

                            <div>
                                <p>The law-malking process has several 'checks and balances,' processes that aim to ensure that no one has too much power.</p>
                                <p>The government is made up of elected representatives, and gets elected every three years, which prevents it from holding power. The government is often questioned by the other MPs in a regularly scheduled <i>Question Time</i>. This is an opportunity for the government to explain their reasoning for their decisions and also an opportunity for the opposition to outline their concerns with them. Cross party <i>Select Committees</i> are committees of MPs formed around specific issues who work together to scrutinise the governments actions, by reviwing reports, conductinig inquiries and consulting the public.</p>
