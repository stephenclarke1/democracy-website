                                <p>They also say that because a 16 year old can have a job and pay income tax, learn to drive, own a firearms license, and have sex, they ought to have a say in our democracy.</p>

                                <h2>How Voting Works</h2>
                            </header>
                                <p>In 1993, New Zealand switched to the MMP system of voting, from the <i>FPP</i> (First-past-the-post) system. This was in an effort to make the democratic system more representative of New Zealanders' views.</p>
                                <header class="post-header">
                                    <h2 id="fpp">FPP</h2>
                                </header>
                                <p>Under the old FPP system, everyone <a href="#votingrights">eligible to vote</a> would get 1 vote, where they would vote for the person to represent their area in parliament, so all seats were electorate seats. The candidate with the most votes is elected to parliament.</p>
                                <p> In this example, Hairy Maclary has recieved 100 votes, more than any of the other candidates, so is elected to parliament.</p>
                                <figure class="img-centre">

                                <p>There are some possible problems with this system</p>
                                <p>In the above example, Hairy Maclary was elected with only 37.5% of the vote, with the majority of voters favouring other candidates. If this were in a safe Hoiho
                                    Party seat, the 125 voters who did not vote for Mr Maclary have no other way of having a say in the make-up of parliament.</p>
                                <p>Critics of this system also say it favours a two-party system,  and excludes minor parties. If the Kiwi Party consistently recieved 15% of the votes in all of the electorates, they would have recieved 15% of the <i>popular vote</i> (the total votes in the election), but no representation in parliament.</p>

                                <p>MMP sought to make the share of seats in parliament more reflective of the popular vote, and is our current system of electing MPs.</p>
                                <p>Under MMP, every <a href="#votingrights">eligible voter</a> gets two votes, one for a candidate who represents their electorate and another for the party that they want to represent them.</p>

                                </header>
                                <p>The electorate vote is similar to the first-past-the-post system, where the candidate with the most votes is elected to represent their electorate, which roughly has a population of 65,000 people. Crucially, not all of the seats in parliament are electorate seats, and a minimum of 48 are elected from the party vote.</p>
                                <header class="post-header">
                                    <h3 id="partyvote">Party Vote</h3>
                                </header>
                                <p>The party vote can be a bit more difficult to understand, so I'll try and make this easy to follow.</p>
                                <p>Your party vote decides the proportion of the 120 seats that each party recieves. In our current system, for a party to be represented in the house they must pass <i>the electoral threshold</i>. In order to pass the threshold, a party must either:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Recieve 5% (or more) of the total party vote, or</li>
                                    <li>Win an electorate seat</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>When they pass the threshold, a party is entitled to their share of the seats based on the proportion of the party vote that they recieved (excluding the parties that did not pass the threshold). I'll use the 2020 election as an example:</p>
                                <iframe title="2020 Election Results" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-ejqlF" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ejqlF/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="572" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
                                </script>
                                <p>Te Pāti Māori earned 1.2% of the party vote, so would get no seats in parliament, but because Rawiri Waititi won the seat of Waiariki, it is entitled to its full share of seats, which gives them another list MP.</p>
                                <p>New Zealand First, on the other hand, despite earning 3% of the party vote, won no electorate seats, so gets no seats in the house.</p>
