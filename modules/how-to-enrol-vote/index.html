                            </header>
                                <p>In 1993, New Zealand switched to the MMP system of voting, from the <i>FPP</i> (First-past-the-post) system. This was in an effort to make the democratic system more representative of New Zealanders' views.</p>
                                <header class="post-header">
                                    <h2 id="fpp">FPP</h2>
                                </header>
                                <p>Under the old FPP system, everyone <a href="#votingrights">eligible to vote</a> would get 1 vote, where they would vote for the person to represent their area in parliament, so all seats were electorate seats. The candidate with the most votes is elected to parliament.</p>
                                <p> In this example, Hairy Maclary has recieved 100 votes, more than any of the other candidates, so is elected to parliament.</p>
                                <figure class="img-centre">
                                    <iframe title="FPP" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-jrFak" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jrFak/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="263" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

                                <p>There are some possible problems with this system</p>
                                <p>In the above example, Hairy Maclary was elected with only 37.5% of the vote, with the majority of voters favouring other candidates. If this were in a safe Hoiho
                                    Party seat, the 125 voters who did not vote for Mr Maclary have no other way of having a say in the make-up of parliament.</p>
                                <p>Critics of this system also say it favours a two-party system,  and excludes minor parties. If the Kiwi Party consistently recieved 15% of the votes in all of the electorates, they would have recieved 15% of the <i>popular vote</i> (the total votes in the election), but no representation in parliament.</p>

                                <p>MMP sought to make the share of seats in parliament more reflective of the popular vote, and is our current system of electing MPs.</p>
                                <p>Under MMP, every <a href="#votingrights">eligible voter</a> gets two votes, one for a candidate who represents their electorate and another for the party that they want to represent them.</p>

                                <p>The electorate vote is similar to the first-past-the-post system, where the candidate with the most votes is elected to represent their electorate. Crucially, not all of the seats in parliament are electorate seats, and a minimum of 48 are elected from the party vote.</p>
